# loancalc
Goal: 
* A loan calculator for unsub loans
* The purpose of this to help a friend better understand the math behind his student loans.
* I spent sometime reverse engineering the math understanding how the interest grew with each loan. 

* Loan services don't explicity tell you how it grows i.e monthly, daily and can change how the loan growth 
is predicted. 
* This is important to know when you want to pay off your loan quickly and understand how much you need to pay where you arent constantly just paying off interest.

* Its a just fun way to use python and a good way to show how unsubizied loans work. 

* My future goal is to turn this into a calculator with a gui potentially figure out a universal way to reformualte all student loans.
