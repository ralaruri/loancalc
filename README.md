A loan calculator for unsub loans

The purpose of this to help a friend better understand the math behind his student loans.
I spent sometim reservse engineering the math understanding how the intrest grew with each loan. 
Loan services dont explicity tell you how it grows i.e monthly, daily and can change how the loan growth 
is predicted. This is important to know when you want to pay off your loan quickly and understand how much you need to pay where you arent constantly just paying off intrest.

Its a just fun way to use python.

My future goal is to turn this into a calculator with a gui
